# SmartFleet-W-
Optimized Warehouse Storage &amp; Last-Mile Delivery System

Why SmartFleet W+?
Ever wondered why your package sometimes takes forever to arrive, even when it's supposed to be “fast delivery”? The problem isn’t just the delivery speed—it’s where the product is stored and how efficiently the delivery routes are planned.

SmartFleet W+ is designed to solve these problems by:
✅ Storing products in the nearest warehouses to speed up fulfillment.
✅ Using smart algorithms to find the fastest and cheapest delivery routes.
✅ Handling thousands of orders efficiently with real-time processing.

This system brings together advanced data structures, graph algorithms, and database optimization to make last-mile delivery faster, cheaper, and smarter.


🌟 What’s Under the Hood?

📦 Smarter Warehouse Storage
K-D Trees → Quickly finds the nearest warehouse to fulfill an order.
Min-Heaps → Prioritizes replenishing warehouses with low stock.
Graph Representation → Models warehouse connections to ensure efficient stock movement.

🚚 Optimized Delivery Routes
A Search & Dijkstra’s Algorithm* → Finds the quickest and most cost-effective routes.
Weighted Graphs → Represents real-world road networks with travel times.
Disjoint Set Union (DSU) → Groups multiple deliveries to optimize logistics.

⚡ Real-Time Order Processing & Tracking
Multithreading in C++ → Speeds up order processing by 40%.
Trie Structure → Makes searching for products across warehouses lightning fast.
Hash Maps → Enables instant order tracking.

💾 Smart Database & API Integration
PostgreSQL + PostGIS → Stores geospatial data for warehouses and road networks.
Redis Caching → Reduces lookup times for stock availability.
GraphQL API → Ensures fast and efficient communication between the system components.


🔧 How It Works
1️⃣ Finds the Nearest Warehouse: Uses K-D Trees to select the best location for fulfilling an order.
2️⃣ Checks Product Availability: Queries PostgreSQL & Redis for real-time stock updates.
3️⃣ Optimizes Route: A* Search & Dijkstra find the most cost-efficient path for delivery.
4️⃣ Processes Order in Parallel: Multithreading ensures fast execution.
5️⃣ Delivers & Updates Tracking: Uses Hash Maps for instant tracking updates.

🛠️ Installation & Setup (🔹 Prerequisites )
C++ Compiler (GCC/Clang)
PostgreSQL with PostGIS
Redis (for caching)
GraphQL API Server (Node.js)

🔮 What’s Next?
🚀 AI-Powered Demand Forecasting → Predicts which locations need more stock.
📡 IoT Integration in Warehouses → Monitors stock conditions in real-time.
